Images from a scope showing the affect (good) of adding a 220K
resistor to the anode switching circuit. This decresed the time to the
off state from ~260us to 172us. It's hard to know if this is really an
improvement since the Anode voltage drops below Vm pretty fast in
either case. But, since the voltage drops to zero in 172us, that can
be the blanking interval. Since it looks like the anode voltage drops
below 100 in about 100us, might try that for the blanking interval.

The pictures are

Anode_10x_with_220k.png: The anode voltage with the 220k shunt resistor
Anode_10x_wo_220k.png: The anode voltage without the 220k shunt resistor

Anode_on_with_1466us.png: Measuring the time the anode is on when the
code uses a on delay time of 1466us

Anode_blanking.png: Measuring the time to turn the anode off, blanking
time wa 200us and this is with the 220K resistor

Anode_switch_MPSA42_base.png: What is looks like at the base of the
MPSA42 where the Arduino triggers the Anode, without the 220K shunt on
the anode.
